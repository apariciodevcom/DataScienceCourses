# Data Science Courses
## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (COURSERA)
<p>I started to take notes from the 3rd Course: Data Science Methodology:</p>
<p>The Data Science Methodology aims to answer the following 10 questions in this prescribed secuency:</p>
<p><strong>What is Data Science?</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the problem that your are triying to solve?</li>
  <li>How can you use the data to answer the question?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Science Methodology</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What data do you need to answer the cuestion?</li>
  <li>Where is the data coming from (identify all sources) and how you will get it?</li>
  <li>Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?</li>
  <li>What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tools for Data Science</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In what way can the data be visualized to get the answer that is required?</li>
  <li>Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?</li>
  <li>Can you put the model in the practice?</li>
  <li>Can you get construtive feedback into answering the question?</li>
</ol>
